## :mortar_board: **What did I learn from this project**

In this project I learned how to implement [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to demonstrate 4 different Map views. This involved implementing Angular's [After View Init](https://angular.io/api/core/AfterViewInit) Lifecycle to ensure that the map appears after the component's view initialization. I also learned to implement CRUD operations on map markers, and to store markers with [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
